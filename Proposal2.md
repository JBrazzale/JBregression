# Linear Regression Proposal
## Joseph Brazzale (9/22/21)

### Question
- Framing question???? predictive model that will predict which genres will generate more box office revenue
- Who benefits??? The movie studio executives who I am pitching my idea to. 

### Data
- I am planning on obtaining two data sets for this project. All of my data on revenue from films will come from Boxofficemojo.
  All other film details (release date, genre, country) will come from IMDB. 
- All data will be obtained via a webscrape, I will use Beautifulsoup to perform the scrape in Python.
- Each individual film will serve as our unit of analysis. The film budget and box office revenue will be our most important features. 

### Tools 
- I plan to use BeautifulSoup alongside of Python to scrape the data from the websites.
- I will then use Python and a few of its libraries like scikit-learn and Pandas to analyze the data.
- Any visualizations will be made using Seaborn. 

### MVP 
- My Minimum Viable product will look like...
