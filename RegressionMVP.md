## MVP for Predicting Box Office Success - Joseph Brazzale
### 09/28/21

- for this project, my intention is to highlight features that will be the best indicator of a movie's success. I will be measuring 
  a movie's success by its net box office revenue.
- I am currently in the feature engineering phase of this project. My web scrape is finished, and I have cleaned the data. This process 
  consisted of removing duplicate titles, setting a minimum threshold for budget, and removing all documentaries.
- Of all of my features, budget is showing the strongest correlation to revenue so far. In its current state, my budget data is highly
  skewed due to most of the films being low to mid-budget. The existence of "blockbuster" films with high budgets and revenue is the culprit here.
- My only visual at the moment is a heatmap that shows the correlation between a few features. The features I select for my final project 
  might change after further analysis.
